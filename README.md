# SmartHome Dashboard Console

Repository for my SmartHome console application for M30235 PAPL

## Overview of Project

This project required me to design, build and demonstrate a SmartHome Console Dashboard in Java.

With a back-end for initilising objects and storing them, I was then required to create a Command Line front-end (CLI) to interact with the back-end. 

## Back-end & Front-end code

The code for this project can be found in ```./SmartHome/src``` and is run through the console.
